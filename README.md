# Awesome 4.x archKiss
### by lgaggini


## README
This is my theme and configuration file for Awesome 4.x WM inspired by Archlinux dark colors and KISS (Keep it simple stupid) philosophy. 
It uses icons from other [great awesome themes](https://github.com/mikar/awesome-themes) (see credits for details).
I using it with GTK [vertex-theme dark](https://github.com/horst3180/vertex-theme) theme available for GTK 3 and GTK 2.
Recently introcuded some great ideas from [awesome-copycats](https://github.com/copycat-killer/awesome-copycats).

## CONFIGURATION

I have some variable to control what to show in the panel bar on top, you can customize as you wish.
I have also some variable to control what default applications to use. In the configuratio the default applications labels are used instead of program name,
e.g. browser instead of Chromium, so it remains quite solid.
By beautiful you can choose between two themes:
* theme_default.lua: heavily based on default colors
* theme.lua: extends the default colors

```lua
-- Themes define colours, icons, and wallpapers
beautiful.init("/home/lg/.config/awesome/themes/kiss/theme_default.lua")

-- User / hostname info
user_hostname = false

-- Kernel version monitoring
kernel_mon = true

-- Uptime
uptime = false

-- Nic interfaces to monitor, fifo
nics = {"enp0s25", "wlo1"}

-- Maildir monitor, false or maildir location
mail_mon = false

-- Switch to enable hwmonitor
hwmonitor = true

-- Switch to enable battery monitoring
laptop = true

-- Mountpoint(s) to monitor
mounts = " /: ${/ used_p}% ~: ${/home used_p}%"

-- Enable full calendar on 2nd monitor
full_cal = true

-- Enable mpd bar
mpd = true

-- This is used later as the default applications to run.
